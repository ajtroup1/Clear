TODO: add links to resources

This repo contains tinkering on interpreters and compilers

If I care about one of the subfolders that exists in this repo, than hopefully it should have a corresponding `README.md` file to explain what's going on there


I've been using multiple resources such as:
- Writing an Interpreter in Go by `Thorston Ball`
- Writing a Compiler in Go also by `Thorston Ball`
- `Tyler Laceby`'s series on parsing with the Pikachu on the cover
- `Pixeled`'s series on writing a compiler in C++
- The classic Crafting Interpreters
- My project `GoDocs`, which operates similarly to Doxygen or Rust's documentation generator
  - Maybe the most I've learned during a project
  - Helped me realize that Parsers can be simple organizers that arrange information in a hierarchal, object-oriented manner
  - AST visualizers also help illustrate this point
