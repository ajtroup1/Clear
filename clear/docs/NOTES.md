# General Notes

A collection of random notes taken from learning throughout the project

## Runes vs. Bytes

- Go does not use a traditional `char` data type
  - This is done to adapt to modern character symbol sets

- The `byte` data type represents traditional ASCII characters
- The `rune` data type represents a broader Unicode character set in UTF-8 format
