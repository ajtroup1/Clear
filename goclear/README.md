# GoClear

The Go implementation of Clear

## Overview

This is my first time building a programming language completely independently, without resources

Go is maybe the language I'm most comfortable with and probably the language I like the most, so I'm using it

This is also the first time I'm making an object-oriented language, which is always what I imagined Clear to

## Usage

GoClear can run in one of 2 ways at the moment:
- Run one file
- Run multiple files sequentially
  - Useful for testing

There are also some informational options when running code:
- Debug mode:
  - By adding the `-d` flag after specifying a file path, if will run Clear in Debug mode
    - Debug mode will display information about lexing, parsing, and later evaluation. For example:
      - Displays all tokens generated by the Lexer
      - Dumps the AST generated by the Parser to either JSON or the terminal using Litter
        - See below for those options
- Dump json mode:
  - Changed in main.go, at the top of main()
  - **Key note about JSON files: they get deleted and reset on every program execution, regardless of JSON mode, so save that information if necessary**
  - Boolean denoting whether to dump the AST to a JSON file in the /jsons folder
    - This works for executing a directory of files as well, it just generates multiple JSON files in the folder
    - Extremely useful for representing an AST in a somewhat visual manner
- Dump litter mode:
  - Also changed in main.go, at the top of main()
  - Litter is an external library that can dump a JSON-like structure (like an AST) to the terminal in a nice format
  - So, litterMode just prints the structured AST in the terminal
