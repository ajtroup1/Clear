# TODO
- **I have to restructure the parser to be STATICALLY TYPED**
- Column and line numbers need to be reevaluated
- Handle unterminated strings
- Go through debug mode and figure out what exactly to print and how to convery what information
  - What is necessary to be displayed? In what format to display it (terminal, log file, etc)? How much do I display before it becomes verbose?
  - Add verbose debug mode, which shows even more information about the Lexing, Parsing, whatever process
- Variable scope and naming duplicates
- Make the parser object oriented
- Arrays
  - Are they going to be a library?
  - In modern languages I feel like they have to be built in
- Can always improve error messaging and handling
- Have chat gpt come up with unique scripts to execute to handle edge cases i can't think of
