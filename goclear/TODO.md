# TODO

- High Level
  - Make the parser object oriented
  - Think through debug mode and figure out what exactly to print and how to convery what information
    - What is necessary to be displayed? In what format to display it (terminal, log file, etc)? How much do I display before it becomes verbose?
  - Performance testing
  - Documentation
  - Error handling and recovery can always be improved
  - Optional generation of logs

- General Additions
  - Imports
    - Import other .clr files
      - Need to think about how to handle transferring data between files
        - Export system?
