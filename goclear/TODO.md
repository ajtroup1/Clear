# TODO
- **I have to restructure the parser to be STATICALLY TYPED**
  - This is due to issues with the transition to object-orientied
  - It is optimal for the host language being Go since Go is statically typed
    - This makes dynamic typing take extra steps since Go types are not inferred
  - Static typing is also just more performant
  - I was going to make a statically typed language eventually, so let's go for it
- Column and line numbers need to be reevaluated
- Handle unterminated strings
- Make the parser object oriented
- Arrays
  - Are they going to be a library?
  - In modern languages I feel like they have to be built in
- Can always improve error messaging and handling
- Have chat gpt come up with unique scripts to execute to handle edge cases i can't think of
