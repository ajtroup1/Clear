/* 
  Functions are a pivotal tool in coding, so of course Clear supports them
  Clear uses the 'fn' keyword as opposed to 'func' or 'function'
  Data types for function parameters are comma delimited and use a TypeScript-style initialization format
  -  parameter: dataType, otherParam: dataType
  Return types are denoted with and arrow
  -  '->' OR '=>'
  -  The return type arrow IS REQUIRED, and 'void' is a valid return type
